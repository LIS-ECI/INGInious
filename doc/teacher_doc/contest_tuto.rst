If you are using the webapp, this procedure can be done using the graphical interface:

#. Go to the *Course administration/Contests* page and click on *Create new contest*.
#. In the *Basic settings* tab fill the required parameters.
#. In the *Problems* tab, select every problem that you want to use in the contest. You can use two methods:
    - Manually: Here you can select every problem that you want to use manually. Click the *Manually* button, select the problem that you want to use from the list and click 'Add'. You can see the problem statement using the *Preview* button too.
    - Automatically: Here you can generate a contest using defined parameters. To add a parameter to be used in the generation process, click the *Add a new type* button, fill the required parameters and click *Add* button. When you have selected all parameters you want to use, click the *Generate!* button.
#. Click the *Save changes* button. The contest will be created waiting for submissions and active if you selected the *Enabled* checkbox.
